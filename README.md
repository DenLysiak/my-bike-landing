Landing page is built on basic HTML and SCSS.
Consists of 20 separate scss blocks one HTML file and utilities folder with reusable mixins, variables, and normalized tags.
All scss files connected to one index.scss file. Page has mixins to adapt layout according screen width, container mixin to set paddings equaly throught the page and grid mixin to keep page adaptive.
Throught app scss pseudo-classes such as: 'hover', 'active', 'visited', 'focus', '-webkit-autofill' - are used to make appropriate style changes.
To style separate elements pseudo-elements are used such as: 'placeholder', 'after/before elements'.
Also, to avoid style mistakes separate variables file is used to keep all repetitive styles in one place. All images and icons are placed in separate folder, compresed and some icons are used as 'svg' files to keep best resolutions.
